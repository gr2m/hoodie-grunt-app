# A basic Hoodie App with Grunt Setup

## setup

```
hoodie new myappname -t gr2m/hoodie-grunt-app
cd myappname
grunt serve
```

The app is using [grunt hoodie](https://github.com/ro-ka/grunt-hoodie)
to start the Hoodie Server in the background, then
connect with a proxy on `http://localhost/_api`. That
we you can benefit from all the grunt goodies while
developing, while still have a working API endpoint
fro Hoodie.
